I've created a modern, responsive web application for renting precision farming tools with the following features:

Clean, professional UI with a green color scheme appropriate for agricultural applications
Responsive layout that works well on mobile and desktop
Tool catalog with filtering capabilities:
Category-based filtering
Location-based search
Price filtering
Tool cards showing:
High-quality images
Tool descriptions
Pricing
Booking functionality
Search functionality in the header
User account access
The application is built with:

TypeScript for type safety
Tailwind CSS for styling
Lucide React for icons
Responsive design principles
Accessible HTML structure
Next steps could include:

Implementing the booking system backend
Adding authentication
Integrating a map for location-based search
Adding the AI recommendation system
Implementing the voice assistant
Adding more filter options and sorting capabilities
